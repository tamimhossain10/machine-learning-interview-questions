## Topics Covered

This repository includes questions on the following topics:

- **Machine Learning**: Fundamental concepts, algorithms, and applications.
- **Deep Learning**: Advanced techniques and architectures.
- **AI and LLM**: Understanding artificial intelligence and large language models.
- **System Design**: Designing scalable machine learning systems.
- **Interview Preparation**: Strategies and tips for interview success.

### Example Questions

1. **What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?**
   - Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, while unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data.

2. **What are some common algorithms used in machine learning?**
   - Algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks.

3. **Explain overfitting and underfitting.**
   - Overfitting occurs when a model learns noise in the training data, while underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture the underlying trend.

4. **What is cross-validation?**
   - Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how a model will generalize to an independent dataset.

5. **Describe the concept of gradient descent.**
   - Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function by iteratively adjusting model parameters.
